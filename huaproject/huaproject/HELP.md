# Project 
The goal of this project is to make a system where students could declare their preferences about a post-graduate academic 
program with courses. A student will have to give some information in order to file an application, such as his under-graduate 
program, grade, and 2 teachers who gave him letter of recomendation. The secretariat will look at the applications and determine 
if an application meets the criteria and a group of teachers will evaluate the applications.
